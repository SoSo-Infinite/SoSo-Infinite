I build Production-Ready Systems with extreme Velocity.

🚀 Technical Founder & System Architect

My focus is on rapidly prototyping and deploying Tier-1 MVPs that demonstrate full-stack architectural maturity, data persistence strategies, and resilience. I specialize in leveraging advanced tooling (including Generative AI and modern frameworks) to achieve product readiness in record time.

My value is in translating complex requirements into simple, scalable, and deployable technical blueprints.

🌐 Architectural Showcase: Tier-1 System Prototypes

These projects are deployed as single-file applications, demonstrating end-to-end knowledge of System Design, Data Integrity, and API Resilience.

🤖 AI Policy Statement 

"In an era of advanced tooling, my primary role is as an Architectural Director. I utilize the Gemini API and other generative platforms not as a simple coding tool, but as a force multiplier to validate architectural choices, accelerate boilerplate creation, and manage the execution of production-ready systems. The architecture and strategic direction are 100% human-designed and owned."

🤝 Strategic Engagement

I seek roles where architectural leadership, rapid execution, and technical decision-making are paramount.
